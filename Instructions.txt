Works with Tensorflow GPU v1.15.

To execute the project you have to:

-Extract AmbientAssistedLiving_App.zip and import the project into Android Studio, and install the apk in the mobile and run it.

-Extract Simulator.zip and import it into Unity3D to be able to record new videos from the simulator.

-Extract Kafka.zip in a folder called kafka, in the Local Disk (C:), and then run the script runKafka.bat from the kafkafinal folder.

-Extract APIREST.zip and chatbot.zip and execute both in separate command line terminals.

-Extract AmbientAssistedLiving_ESB.zip and import the project into Anypoint Studio and run it as Mule Application.
Modify the paths corresponding to the flows that get the CEP files.

-Extract CEP.zip and indicate the path where they have been extracted in the corresponding flows of Anypoint Studio. 
Once the ESB is deployed, move the schema from the deployedSchema folder to the newSchema folder and for the patterns also 
move the file found in deployedEventPattern to newEventPattern.

-Finally, follow the documentation installation manual regarding tensorflow, extract SoftwareDeteccion.zip 
and run the softwareDeteccion.py file.
